# Hashing Engine

This project leverages cryptographic principles to enhance data security. It utilizes well-established hashing algorithms, including SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, and MD5, to generate hash values by encrypting user-provided text via a user-friendly interface created with Tkinter. Additionally, the project offers the capability to reverse-engineer and decode text that has been encoded using these algorithms.

To run this project, you'll need a Python interpreter installed on your computer, typically bundled with the Python package. Tkinter, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces, is also required. Fortunately, Tkinter is often included with Python or can be separately installed if necessary. We've developed and tested this project using popular integrated development environments (IDEs) such as PyCharm and VSCode.

Furthermore, we've incorporated the renowned "RockYou.txt" file, a common password dictionary, to facilitate password deciphering and validation.

Feel free to explore this project and enhance your understanding of cryptography and data security.
